## Learning Outcomes

The development of this project allowed me to build something of my own. It was an amazing experience as I would develop the functionality of this website on a day-to-day basis, simply by thinking about how I would like it to look and function, and jotting my ideas and processes on a whiteboard.

The biggest challenge that I faced was the actual deployment of the website. The website is hosted on github but I had to find a way link the domain name to this github repository. 

Aside from the actual day-to-day development putting this website together, my favorite part was constantly optimize the code, always find a way to make the code more efficient. I thoroughly enjoyed getting down to the details.
